# Grab Bag Project

A web application that fetches a grid of devices from iFixit's API and allows users to drag and drop devices they own into their "grab bag." The grid of devices uses pagination to fetch the next sequence of devices from the API. The list of devices that the user selects for their grab bag is saved into the HTML5 storage engine. Overflow from the grab bag is handled with scrolling. Built using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and React.
